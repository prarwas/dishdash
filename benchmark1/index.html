<h1>DISH DASH - Game Design Document</h1>
<h4>By Prarthana Biswas, Benson Chen, and William Lee</h4>
<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This document describes a game called "Dish Dash", which is designed to be a simple, 2D side-scroller, where players become servers that have to rush to collect ingredients in order to create the dishes customers want. The game takes place in a food court with a total of 6 levels, where 2 levels are designated to each food vendor. The game will employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, AI, side scrolling & gravity, efficient memory management, render threading, and more basic 2D game techniques.</p>

  <h2>Technology</h2>
  <p>Dish Dash will be developed for the Windows Platform using the McKilla's Gorilla game engine, which is a bare-bones engine developed by Richard McKenna for rapid prototyping 2D games. DirectX will be used as the underlying rendering technology. XACT will be used for all music and sound effects management. Artwork will be brutally simple, and so we'll simply use MS Paint.</p>

  <h2>Back Story</h2>
  <p>After a devastating rainstorm floods Stony Brook's dining areas, leaving students and staff without a place to eat, the campus faces widespread hunger. In response to the crisis, the beloved university mascot, Wolfie, steps up as a savior by opening a vibrant food court: Dish Dash! No longer forced to rely on cheap instant noodles, students and faculty can now satisfy their appetites at this bustling hub.</p>
  <p>As an added incentive, students who join the ranks as servers at Dish Dash have the opportunity to attend the university for freeâ€”on the condition that they never fail to please a customer. With the campus community counting on them, these student servers must navigate the bustling food court, balancing speed, efficiency, and customer satisfaction, all while striving to keep hunger at bay and ensure everyone leaves with a smile.</p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>In Dish Dash, the goal is to navigate through six challenging levels, where two of each are focused on a designated food vendor within the bustling food court. Time is of the essence as you strive to serve each customer within the allotted time frame, ensuring efficiency and satisfaction. As the timer ticks down, you must expedite orders, coordinate kitchen operations, and optimize serving strategies to meet the demands of hungry customers. With each level presenting new culinary delights and increasing complexity, you'll need to stay cool under pressure and maintain a steady pace to succeed. Navigate through a diverse array of food options, from burgers to baguettes, mastering the unique challenges of each vendor. Only by meeting the time-sensitive demands of each customer can you progress through the levels, earning the honor as the ultimate culinary maestro and ensuring Dish Dash's reputation as the go-to dining destination on campus!</p>
